# INTRODUCTION

I'm doing some research with git and PHP with Angular. The main idea is make a project with some microservices.
Maybe a chat room in the future.

This is the main site where we can manage our posts with our users and with our comments.

We'll use this micro service to:
  * Register new users
  * Sign In
  * Edit user.

  * Create new posts.
  * Edit posts.
  * Comment posts.
